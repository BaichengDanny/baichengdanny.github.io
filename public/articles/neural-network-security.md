# Neural Network Security: Attack Vectors and Defense Strategies

As neural networks become increasingly deployed in critical systems, understanding their security vulnerabilities becomes paramount.

## Common Attack Vectors

### Adversarial Examples

Adversarial examples are carefully crafted inputs designed to fool neural networks into making incorrect predictions. These attacks can be:

- **Targeted**: Forcing the model to predict a specific incorrect class
- **Untargeted**: Simply causing misclassification without caring about the specific wrong answer
- **Physical**: Attacks that work in the real world, not just digitally

### Model Extraction

Attackers can attempt to steal machine learning models by:

1. Querying the model with carefully chosen inputs
2. Analyzing the outputs to reverse-engineer the model architecture
3. Training a surrogate model that mimics the original

### Data Poisoning

This involves corrupting the training data to influence the model's behavior:

- **Clean-label attacks**: Poisoning data without changing labels
- **Label-flipping attacks**: Changing labels of training examples
- **Backdoor attacks**: Inserting triggers that cause specific behaviors

## Defense Mechanisms

### Adversarial Training

Training models on adversarial examples to improve robustness:

```python
def adversarial_training(model, data, labels, epsilon=0.01):
    """
    Train model with adversarial examples
    """
    for batch_data, batch_labels in zip(data, labels):
        # Generate adversarial examples
        adv_examples = generate_adversarial(batch_data, epsilon)

        # Train on both clean and adversarial data
        model.train_step(batch_data, batch_labels)
        model.train_step(adv_examples, batch_labels)

    return model
```

### Defensive Distillation

Using knowledge distillation to create more robust models:

$$T_{soft} = \frac{\exp(z_i/T)}{\sum_j \exp(z_j/T)}$$

Where $T$ is the temperature parameter that softens the probability distribution.

### Input Preprocessing

Applying transformations to inputs to remove adversarial perturbations:

- Image denoising
- JPEG compression
- Random transformations

## Conclusion

Neural network security requires a multi-layered approach combining robust training methods, defensive architectures, and runtime protections. As attacks become more sophisticated, our defenses must evolve accordingly.
